## üîß Project Overview

The Smart Grow Box automates lighting, watering, and ventilation using real-time sensor data. Built around a Raspberry Pi Pico W, it features:

- Scheduled LED grow lighting
- Soil moisture-based irrigation control
- Time-based and sensor-triggered fan ventilation
- Temperature and humidity monitoring (AHT21 sensor)
- Local web server for live status display and manual override
- Event logging for traceability of all actions

The system is designed for low-power operation using a 12V lithium battery and supports long-term autonomous use.
